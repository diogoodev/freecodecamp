# Build a Palindrome Checker

This project is an implementation of a palindrome checker, which identifies words or phrases that read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build an app that is functionally similar to [this example](https://palindrome-checker.freecodecamp.rocks).

## User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to input a text into the app.
- As a user, I should be able to click on a button to check if the input text is a palindrome.
- As a user, if I click the check button without entering any text, I should receive an alert saying "Please input a value".
- As a user, if the input text is a palindrome, the result should display that the text is indeed a palindrome.
- As a user, if the input text is not a palindrome, the result should display that the text is not a palindrome.

### Test Cases

- When the input contains the text "eye", the result should display "eye is a palindrome".
- When the input contains the text "_eye", the result should display "_eye is a palindrome".
- When the input contains the text "race car", the result should display "race car is a palindrome".
- When the input contains the text "not a palindrome", the result should display "not a palindrome is not a palindrome".
- When the input contains the text "A man, a plan, a canal. Panama", the result should display "A man, a plan, a canal. Panama is a palindrome".
- When the input contains the text "never odd or even", the result should display "never odd or even is a palindrome".
- When the input contains the text "nope", the result should display "nope is not a palindrome".
- When the input contains the text "almostomla", the result should display "almostomla is not a palindrome".
- When the input contains the text "My age is 0, 0 si ega ym.", the result should display "My age is 0, 0 si ega ym. is a palindrome".
- When the input contains the text "1 eye for of 1 eye.", the result should display "1 eye for of 1 eye. is not a palindrome".
- When the input contains the text "0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0", the result should display "0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0 is a palindrome".
- When the input contains the text "five|_/|four", the result should display "five|_/|four is not a palindrome".

## How to Use

1. Enter a text into the input field.
2. Click the "Check" button to determine if the entered text is a palindrome.
3. View the result displayed below the input field.
